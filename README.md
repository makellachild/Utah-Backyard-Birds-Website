# Utah-Backyard-Birds-Website

Originally finished April 25th, 2019. 
This is a website I created for a web design class. It is for a fake online aviary photography business that sells calendars, postcards, etc. 
All content made was for educational purposes

All project items can be found in the Project09 folder. I used GIMP and Notepad++
